TouchWheelNavigationEvents Example: print out the events

If you are running this code on a new board, 
please measure the range of touch inputs.

Supported events:
- Finger rotating on the wheel (dial)
- Finger releasing from a button (release)
- Finger hold on a button for 1 second (long)
- Finger touching to anywhere on the wheel (press)
    - usually press events are only used for viual/sound effect
    - real actions are taken on release/long and dial events.

dependency:
- CircuitPython 7+
